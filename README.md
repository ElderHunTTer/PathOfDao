IAM ARE GONNA MAKE A CULTIVATION BASED NFT

# Why do Most NFTs seem like shit?

The NFTs today are only of perceived value and only worth what ever a person believes they are worth. Most got no use or "Future" use making this incredibly fishy and dangerous to some extent. These are the people jumping on the get rich quick from NFT Wagon.

This problem is what's causing the degrading feel of NFTs and the lost of trust that is associated with a over saturated market full of crap..

## Solution?

EZ. Just release a working product and a full usability NFTs. While the solution is easy the implementation is most definitely not.

### HunTTer's Idea

As you all know me... I'm a huge wuxia fan and I'm obviously gonna go to the exact thing you are thinking... CULTIVATION...! Just basing this NFT on cultivation comes with a lots of boons... The main is that it appeals heavily to the Chinese market as they are huge consumers of all Wuxia and Martial Arts based products.
